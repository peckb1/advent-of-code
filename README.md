# Advent Of Code

It's time to explore the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com).

The solutions are written with the following goals:

1. **Readibility** 
   The code should be immediately understandable, even to those without knowledge of the language used. 

2. **Clean Abstractions**.
   The code should not have any extraneous copy/paste. 
   Everything should fall under the single responsibility principle.
   
   
## Running

The problems are run as unit tests, with their result matching the correct answer
as the value which passed the given day/phase combination

## Highlights

**Favourite problem(s):**

* Day 1 (so far) is the favourite, but nothing complex yet.
  * Phase two being more fun than phase one with the two (2) `windowed` usages

**Interesting approaches:**

* None yet.

## Takeaways

* Setting up a Kotlin project with Dagger should have more examples than the multitude of Android examples out there
